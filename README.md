## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This project is designed as part of a Git Basics assignment to practice fundamental Git operations in a real-world development environment. It walks through setting up a local Git repository, writing and committing code, creating and switching between branches, and finally pushing the changes to a remote repository on GitHub.

The project focuses on building hands-on experience with essential Git commands such as `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git branch`, and `git push`. Additionally, a `.gitignore` file is used to prevent unnecessary files from being tracked, which is a common best practice in professional workflows.

By completing this project, the user becomes familiar with both local version control and remote repository management using GitHub.
